# if you are going to read flat file from other program and share to others
df = pd.read_csv('tsv_without_header_in', sep='\t', header=None, names=your_header, index_col=False, dtype={}, quotechar='\t')  # Quoted items can include the delimiter and it will be ignored.
df.to_csv('tsv_without_header_out', sep='\t', header=False, index=False)
# you can write to HDF5 in order to keep your data_type
df.to_hdf('foo.h5', 'df')
